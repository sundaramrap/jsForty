// T-010: Empty an array using its length property

//  T-011: Create an array of 10 elements(number 1 to 10). Resize the array to length 6 once you find the number 5 in that array. Hint: Use for-loop.
//  T-012: Create an Array of 10 elements. Use the splice() method to empty the array.
//  T-013: Create an Array of 10 elements. You can empty the array in multiple ways: using the length property, using the pop() method, using the shift() method, setting the array with [], or the splice() method. Which among these methods are most efficient and why?
//  T-014: What happens when you concatenate two empty arrays?
//  T-015: How can you check if a value is partially matching with any of the elements of an Array?
//  T-016: What is the difference between the slice() and splice() methods?
//  T-017: Create an Array of alphanumeric strings. Sort the elements in both ascending and descending orders. You must be doing this in an immutable way such that the source array never gets modified.
//  T-018: Can you give examples of sparse and dense arrays?
//  T-019: Give a practical usages of the .fill() method
//  T-020: How to convert an array to a string?
